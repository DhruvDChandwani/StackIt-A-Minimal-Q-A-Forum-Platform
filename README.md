# StackIt-A-Minimal-Q-A-Forum-Platform
StackIt is a minimal Q&amp;A forum like StackOverflow that allows users to ask questions, post answers using a rich text editor, vote, and accept answers. It includes user roles (Guest, User, Admin), tag-based filtering, notifications for activity, and an admin panel for moderation and user management.
